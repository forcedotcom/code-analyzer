Bundle custom PMD rules in JAR files. Follow PMD conventions, such as defining the custom rules in XML files under a `/category/` directory.
See PMD's documentation for more information on writing rules.

This example shows how to specify two JAR files directly.
	$ <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --language apex --path "/Users/me/rules/Jar1.jar,/Users/me/rules/Jar2.jar"
		Successfully added rules for apex.
		2 path(s) added:
		/Users/me/rules/Jar1.jar,/Users/me/rules/Jar2.jar

This example shows how to specify a directory containing one or more JARs, all of which are added to the registry.
	$ <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --language apex --path "/Users/me/rules"
		Successfully added rules for apex.
