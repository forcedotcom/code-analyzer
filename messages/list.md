# examples

This example invokes the command without filter criteria, which returns all rules.
	$ <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %>

This example returns all rules for Apex OR Javascript. Values supplied to a single filter are handled with a logical OR.
	$ <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --language apex,javascript

This example returns all rules except those in the Design or Best Practices categories. Exclude categories by specifying the negation operator and enclosing the values in single quotes.
	$ <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --category '!Design,!Best Practices'

This example returns all rules that target Apex OR Javascript, AND are members of the Braces OR Security rulesets.
The different filters are combined with a logical AND.
	$ <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --language apex,javascript --ruleset Braces,Security
