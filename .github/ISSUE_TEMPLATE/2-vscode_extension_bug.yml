        You can often resolve "vscode-extension" issues on your own. Follow these steps:
        1. Read the error message.
        2. Read [Salesforce Code Analyzer VS Code Extenion](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/analyze-vscode.html) documentation.
        3. Double-check the VS Code extension feature you used. Make sure that items like file names, method names, and category names are correctly spelled and cased.
        4. Verify that you can't reproduce the issue using the appropriate Salesforce CLI command directly.
        5. Verify that your code is syntactically valid.
        6. Verify that the error is reproducible on another computer.
        7. Check open and closed [issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/code-analyzer/issues) to see if your issue is already logged.
