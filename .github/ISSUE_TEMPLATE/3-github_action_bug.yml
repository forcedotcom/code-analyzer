        1. Read the error message.
        2. Read [Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/code-analyzer.html) documentation.
        3. Double-check the command that you ran. Ensure that items like file names, method names, and category names are correctly spelled and cased.
        4. Verify that your code is syntactically valid.
        5. Verify that the error can not be reproduced using the Salesforce CLI directly.
        6. Verify that the error is reproducible on another machine.
        7. Check open and closed [issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/code-analyzer/issues) to see if your issue is already logged.
