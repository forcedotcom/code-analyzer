### Try These Steps to Resolve Issues with `scanner run`

Oftentimes, you can resolve `scanner run` issues on your own. Follow these steps.

1. Read the error message.
2. Read [Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/overview) documentation.
3. Double-check the command that you ran. Ensure that items like file names, method names, and category names are correctly spelled and cased.
4. Verify that your code is syntactically valid.
5. Verify that the error is reproducible on another machine.
6. Attempt to reproduce the error by running against that engine directly instead of via the Code Analyzer. If you can reproduce the error, create an issue on that engine's repo instead of on Code Analyzer's repo.
7. Check open and closed [issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-scanner/issues) to see if your issue is already logged.

### Prepare for an AppExchange Security Review

If you're listing a managed package on AppExchange, prepare for the security review by following the instructions in the [Scan Your Solution with Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_code_analyzer_scan.htm) section of the ISVforce Guide.

### Log a `scanner run` Issue
If you're still having trouble after following the troubleshooting steps and checking that there's no existing issue that covers your situation, log a new `scanner run` issue.

1. Fill out the `scanner run` Issue Template.
2. Attach your code with your issue.
3. If you can't publicly share the code that causes the issue, reproduce it in code that you can publicly share. Attach this substitute code to your issue.
4. Give your issue a clear and specific title. Example: "InternalExecutionError when scanning XYZ code".
