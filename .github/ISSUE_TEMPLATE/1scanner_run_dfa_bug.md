### Prepare for an AppExchange Security Review

If you're listing a managed package on AppExchange, prepare for the security review by following the instructions in the [Scan Your Solution with Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_code_analyzer_scan.htm) section of the ISVforce Guide.

**Note: In your scan report, if you see an InternalExecutionError or a LimitReached error, you can still submit for AppExchange security review. These errors aren't blockers.**
